# st-bagels-game

This is the classic Bagels number-guessing game - but done in Streamlit and leveraging the Streamlit Chat components.

## Description

#### The Bagels Game
* I will think of a {NUM_DIGITS}-digit number.
* Each digit is unique.
* You will try to guess what it is in {MAX_GUESS} guesses or less.

The clues I give (one or more depending on situation) are... 
| **When I say** | **That means**                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| _Bagels_        | None of the digits are correct.                 |
| _Pico_          | One digit is correct but in the wrong position. |
| _Fermi_         | One digit is correct and in the right position. |
